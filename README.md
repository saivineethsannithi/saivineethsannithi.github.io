# 🧑‍💻 Saivineeth Sannithi – Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio! I’m a results-oriented cybersecurity analyst with hands-on experience in threat detection, phishing analysis, and SIEM tools. This GitHub serves as a showcase of the practical projects I’ve developed during my studies and internship, including virtual labs and log analysis setups.
